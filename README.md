# ctf-challenges
Various files for ctf challenges that i've created in the past

### nginx-hidden-site
Players must find the hidden web resource (currently l8P, but can be changed), deobs the javascript found there using jsfuck and get the flag. Included is all the necessary .conf files for nginx to serve the challenge. I used the docker default nginx image for portability.
